    "Metricon Homes has been listed as the top residential building company in Australia for 2020 & 2021. They have been granted a unique oppotunity to buy and develop a Subdivision of land within the King County area of Washington State, USA. They will design homes and build one on each lot of the Subdivision to create an entirely new neighbourhood. \n",
    "Building in America is completely new territory for an Australian based company. Their deparmtents are unsure if their usual building methods and strategies will suit this North American buying market, and are concerned about losing out on profits for the houses they intend to construct. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before construction begins, they wish to see what architectual features of a home within King County may effect the price of the houses they intend to build and sell. It is up to this project to delve into the historical housing data of the area and show the top 2 variables that are most correlated with the price of the house, and provide distinct estimates on how much it increases the value of the properties. This will enable Metricon Homes to have a unique understanding of what may determine house prices within this entirely new region. The business may also use the model on other County's data if they are afforded more projects within North America."
